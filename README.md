# nyxgraph

This C++ library is intended for the analysis of large-scale network data. 
Several design choices were made in nixgraph:

* Scalability to millions of nodes and edges.
* All computation done in-memory and where possible on all available CPU's. 
* Focus is on the analysis of the topology/structure of simple directed and undirected graphs, read from a file. 
* No support for graph models/generators, node or edge attributes, multi-partite networks or visualization (there are many other tools that can do that).   
* Preference for simplicity over complexity; low-level C++ datastructures are preferred over more complex iterators.

## usage
