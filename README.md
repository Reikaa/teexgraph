# teexGraph

This C++ library is intended for large-scale network analysis and computation.

## About

Several explicit design choices were made in in this library:

* Designed to handle millions of nodes and billions of edges.
* All computation done in-memory and where possible on all available CPU's using OpenMP. 
* Focus is on the analysis of the topology/structure of simple directed and undirected graphs, read from a file. 
* No support for graph models/generators, node/edge attributes, node/edge weights, multi-partite networks or visualization (there are other tools that can do that).
* Preference for simplicity over complexity; low-level C++ data structures are used wherever possible, requiring no other libraries than the standard `g++` compiler and the C++ standard library. 

## Features

* Fast computation of the diameter of real-world networks, based on:

* Fast computation of extreme distance metrics: the radius, diameter, center size, periphery size and eccentricity distribution of large real-world networks, based on the algorithms presented in:

## Usage and Installation

* Install using `make` and then run the executable `teexgraph`. 
* The library supports networks with up to INT_MAX (2 billion) nodes and as many edges as the memory of your machine can hold.
* Friendly input files are expected; although comments (lines that do not start with a character in [0-9]) at the beginning of an edge file are allowed.
    After the first line with a pair of integers denoting an edge, only integer pairs are expected.
* Consult the [main.cpp](src/main.cpp) file for examples of how to use the code.
